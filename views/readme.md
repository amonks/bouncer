Hi!

Ever tried to make an HTTP GET request from client-side JavaScript? Maybe to access an API or something?

You can't unless the page you're requesting specifically whitelisted you!

It's terrible!

That's why I exist. I'm a super simple proxy. I accept requests from anyone. 

Simply change the url you're GETing to `http://youwouldntstealacar.com/?url`
